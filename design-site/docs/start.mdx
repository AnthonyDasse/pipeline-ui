# Why Pipeline?

Algorand, and blockchains in general, are powerful technologies that have not seen widespread integration for everyday purposes on existing websites. Pipeline UI aims to make blockchain integration on websites seamless and ubiquitous. 

## What is Pipeline UI?

Pipeline UI is a ready-to-use library to rapidly add standardized Algorand functional components to your React apps. 

## What are the differences with other blockchain libraries?

Pipeline UI reduces the amount of time it takes to integrate Algorand features into existing websites.
