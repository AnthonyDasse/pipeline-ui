## Getting Started

Welcome to Pipeline UI, a library of standardized React components for the Algorand Ecosystem.

### Install the library:

```bash
cd myNewApp
npm install pipeline-ui
```
### Modifying the library:

If you wish to download and modify the library components via source code, run the following code to save it to your user root directory and install its dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/headline-design/pipeline-ui
npm install
```

You may then edit the components via the index.js file found inside each component folder in the parent folder /src. After saving changes, you must then run the following code from the pipeline-ui parent folder:
```bash
npm run build
npm pack
```
